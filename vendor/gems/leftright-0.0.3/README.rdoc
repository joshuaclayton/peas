= leftright

leftright is kind of like the redgreen gem. It makes passing tests look
green, exceptions yellow, and failures red. But then there's more:

  * It lets you know which TestCase class is being tested
  * It shows you the full text of failures and exceptions as they happen
  * It skips all remaining tests for a TestCase class if one fails

== Dependencies

Right now this is pretty heavily dependent on Test::Unit, so it won't work
in Ruby 1.9+ using MiniTest. Support is planned as soon as I find myself
using the Ruby 1.9 + Rails 3 combo day to day.

== Installation instructions

From Rubyforge's gem server (might not be there):

  gem install leftright

From Gemcutter:

  gem install leftright --source http://gemcutter.org

Both are the same, and are loaded the same way:

  require 'leftright'

== Example usage

  require 'leftright'

  class SomeTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    def test_that_true_is_indeed_true
      assert_equal true, true
    end
  end

Then run the file with ruby. Mind you, it gets a lot more exciting with
your own tests, specially if they fail. :)
